- Machine Learning: building models with TensorFlow and saving it using KerasModel Format, preprocess train data with data augmentation and preprocess data before feeding it to models for prediction.

- Cloud: Using Cloud Storage as a model place, implementing Cloud Functions for making endpoint to connect the model from Cloud Storage to Android app

- Android: Android as an interface of an application that can be connected to Machine Learning or Cloud Computing.
